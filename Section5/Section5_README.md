Documentation for Car Evaluation Model:

Introduction:
The Car Evaluation dataset contains information about various cars and their specifications such as buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, number of seats, etc. The objective of this model is to predict the buying price of a car based on its specifications.

Data:
The dataset is available at the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation. It contains 1728 rows and 7 columns. The columns in the dataset are as follows:

buying: Buying price of the car (low, med, high, vhigh)
maint: Maintenance cost of the car (low, med, high, vhigh)
doors: Number of doors (2, 3, 4, 5more)
persons: Number of persons that can be seated in the car (2, 4, more)
lug_boot: Size of the luggage boot (small, med, big)
safety: Safety rating of the car (low, med, high)
class: Classification of the car (unacc, acc, good, vgood)

Model:
We will build a decision tree classifier to predict the buying price of the car. Decision trees are a powerful and interpretable machine learning algorithm that work well with categorical data.

Preprocessing:
The dataset will be preprocessed by converting categorical variables to numerical values using one-hot encoding. This will create additional columns for each categorical variable with binary values indicating the presence or absence of that variable. For example, the 'buying' column will be split into four columns 'buying_low', 'buying_med', 'buying_high', and 'buying_vhigh', with binary values indicating if the buying price is low, med, high, or vhigh.

Training:
The model will be trained using the preprocessed dataset. We will split the dataset into training and testing sets with a 70:30 ratio. The decision tree classifier will be trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. It is worthy to note that the person capacity is the weakest feature as seen in the ipynb file.

Evaluation:
We will evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix will also be generated to visualize the performance of the model.

Deployment:
Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to predict the buying price of a car based on its specifications. The user will input the car's specifications, and the model will return the predicted buying price.

Conclusion:
This model can be used to predict the buying price of a car based on its specifications with reasonable accuracy. The decision tree algorithm is a powerful and interpretable machine learning algorithm that works well with categorical data. With further refinement and tuning, this model can be improved to achieve higher accuracy.
